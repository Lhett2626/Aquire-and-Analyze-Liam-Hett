Bison burger only comes cooked medium here, and that's okay. It was really good. Didn't feel greasy or overbearing. I love venison and bison, so I appreciate it done well in a burger.

Pulled pork was also just, super good. I only stole a couple bites from my boyfriend's plate... but... I really enjoyed the pulled pork. I believe it had a Carolina tangy sweetness that wasn't entirely like some of the Carolina BBQs I loved when I lived in NC, but still very good. I'd definitely come order it myself another time to fully experience.

I also had the flathead mule drink... Wasn't overly sweet or strong, just right for my date and with what I was eating. Pleasant when paired with all the spicy and savoury food.

The only thing I'd tweak is maybe breading the fries. They were otherwise just okay.

I had a lovely dinner all around and plan to come back to enjoy the lovely balcony area. ü•∞",1638142751,Good

Folks behind the sushi bar crushing beers left and right. I'm not against drinking, but this is highly unprofessional.

She was super friendly and quick to refill drinks before they were even close to being empty and to help with anything else we needed. She's great!!

Now the food. We had nachos with potato chips and they were really good. It was a nice twist on original nachos‚Äîthey give you options, too which I really liked. We also ordered the fish and chips, cottage pie and a pick-your-protein kinda of deal with blackened cod. Everything was yummy and it all came out really quick, which was surprising for the amount of people there last night.

My SO and I love their sweet and savory pizzas ‚Äî prosciutto  & fig and the Flathead cherry one are absolutely wonderful.  The crust is very thin but very bubbly to make up for it.

This probably only matters to someone that buys too much with the intention to have it cold ‚Äî we usually have no leftovers.

This last time was less than perfect ‚Äî the Flathead cherry pizza had a ton of mushrooms on it for some reason, which was a very odd combination and not a change mentioned in the menu.  Both of the pizzas we bought had the toppings stop well before the edge of the pizza, making it like we had a 10‚Äù pizza on a 16‚Äù piece of dough (or whatever the sizes are).

Food is constantly cold. Every time I'm coming from campus I am tempted to stop and every time I regret it. Food will be below optimal taco bell temperature even if I eat in the car on my way out of the drive through. We are talking shredded cheese that is still not melted in a grilled burrito. Was it frozen when it went in? And tell your family to preheat the oven if you plan on bringing it home. This taco bell makes me understand why some think taco johns is a better chain (its not). Staff is usually very friendly but I feel bad for those poor college kids having to eat cold burritos. Another tip before I go. Have staff ask about sauce right before they hand you the bag.

They did not originally seat us in his section. The manager lady came up later and did end up moving us. But she tried to put the blame on us for not telling her we had his fiance in the party (even though we had made that clear at the beginning with our request and we saw the girl ask her).

Ultimately, every interaction with that woman was unpleasant and tainted with attitude or at least passive aggressiveness. I did not believe our request was unreasonable but we were treated very poorly simply for asking.

Your place is in trouble. Our visit to the St George location on Sunday 2pm 8-18-19 was terrible. The place had four or five tables seated, we waited a few minutes before a blonde server came out from the back and we picked the large table near the front for all of us. The table and chairs were strewn around and dirty. The server was nice and took our drink orders. We went to begin the line and the beef was empty so I walked around and told another blonde girl who told the manager in the red shirt was trying to help the cooks. The food items were a mess and empty no noodles. Then a very confused thin guy came out and did not have a clue what to do. He wasn‚Äôt cleaning and I could see the items that were empty in the walk in and I could have filled and cleaned the entire station before this guy picked the water chestnuts out of the pineapple one by one and put them back in the other bin. The manager was over his head rushing around instead of delegating employees to cook, clean and replace items. All the way around everything was in a shambles. During the time we waited for a hostess and then seated menus plopped in a pile with the wrong number of forks and napkins atop the menus. No chopsticks no wontons chili paste was out ice cream machine still broken from 2 weeks ago. Cooks just grabbing your bowl, no sanitizer to clean sauce off your hands. You have some serious issues with your staff and management, the guy restocking the items on the line was so out of it he ended up with a pair of tongs in his hand that belonged in the beef and just looked at it in his hand then turned and SLOWLY walked away with it because he couldn‚Äôt figure out where it went. I am very upset with the entire visit",1566177070,Bad

We started with the Butternut squash soup and had to take a moment after the first spoonful yo appreciate the buttery goodness! Then of course we had the fried chickens. It was crazy crispy on the outside and so moist and juicy on the inside! We will definitely be back!,1637112175,Good

Food and service fluctuate as you might expect. Cool atmosphere inside, Deck overlooks the parking lot and alley.
Update: new ownership cleaned the place up nicely. Still hip but not nearly as grungy. The chicken sandwich is outrageous.... Literally. I added a star just for that.",1612849679,Good

Service was 10million times better than it was back in ""the day"". Food was served in a reasonable time frame and we all cleared our plates so I'd say it's above par. To top it off Josh Farmer was playing piano and taking requests and we had a wonderful time tipping him for some requested tunes- really made for a warm atmosphere. Definitely back in to my downtown rotation of dinner choices when guests come to Missoula.",1635969727,Good

The food was amazing, the atmosphere charming and the drinks are phenomenal.
