This probably only matters to someone that buys too much with the intention to have it cold — we usually have no leftovers.\n\nThis last time was less than perfect — the Flathead cherry pizza had a ton of mushrooms on it for some reason, which was a very odd combination and not a change mentioned in the menu.  Both of the pizzas we bought had the toppings stop well before the edge of the pizza, making it like we had a 10” pizza on a 16” piece of dough (or whatever the sizes are).

I think I may stop ordering my fav thing on their menu if they don’t. The corned beef hash was merely their usual hash browns with chopped up pieces of sausage in it, not corned beef, or at least it was unrecognizable as such.

Staff is usually very friendly but I feel bad for those poor college kids having to eat cold burritos. Another tip before I go. Have staff ask about sauce right before they hand you the bag. It makes more sense than placing an order for it and it makes sure it is not missed.

Our visit to the St George location on Sunday 2pm 8-18-19 was terrible.

The table and chairs were strewn around and dirty. The server was nice and took our drink orders. We went to begin the line and the beef was empty so I walked around and told another blonde girl who told the manager in the red shirt was trying to help the cooks. The food items were a mess and empty no noodles. Then a very confused thin guy came out and did not have a clue what to do. He wasn’t cleaning and I could see the items that were empty in the walk in and I could have filled and cleaned the entire station before this guy picked the water chestnuts out of the pineapple one by one and put them back in the other bin. The manager was over his head rushing around instead of delegating employees to cook, clean and replace items. All the way around everything was in a shambles. During the time we waited for a hostess and then seated menus plopped in a pile with the wrong number of forks and napkins atop the menus. No chopsticks no wontons chili paste was out ice cream machine still broken from 2 weeks ago. Cooks just grabbing your bowl, no sanitizer to clean sauce off your hands. You have some serious issues with your staff and management, the guy restocking the items on the line was so out of it he ended up with a pair of tongs in his hand that belonged in the beef and just looked at it in his hand then turned and SLOWLY walked away with it because he couldn’t figure out where it went.
